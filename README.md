## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CUBE CSS

### What I learned

I made an attempt to update my initial solution with CUBE CSS methodology, which I haven't used much before. So I had a chance to use what I learnt about it in practice.

### Continued development

- CUBE CSS
- blend mode
- gradients

### Useful resources

- [CUBE CSS documentation](https://cube.fyi/) - A CSS methodology that I find quite interesting and wish to learn better. I tried to write CSS for this challenge.
- [A look at the CUBE CSS methodology in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NanhQvnvbR8) - This video by [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) got me interested in CUBE CSS. It shows how to use it in practice for another Frontendmentor challenge.
